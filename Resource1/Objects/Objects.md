# Objects

* An object can be created with figure brackets {…} with an optional list of properties. A property is a “key: value” pair, where key is a string (also called a “property name”), and value can be anything.

### Object Creation
* Object can be created using one of 2 syntaxes : 
    1. Constructor Syntax
    2. Literal Syntax

```javascript
    // Constructor Syntax
    const user1 = new Object()

    // Object literal Syntax
    const user2 = {}
```
